# Minimal Preact Boilerplate

This repository contains a Preact web app that does not rely on a build step (e.g., no webpack).

## Key Points
- Preact is pulled in from [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/). See /hosted-files/*index.html*.
- The main Preact Component of each Page is lazy-loaded along with its dependencies. This is done to minimize the initial load time of the app.
